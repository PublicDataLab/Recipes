# üå™Ô∏èüí¨ Filtering tweets based on hashtags

*A recipe to extract a subset of tweets based on one or more hashtags using OpenRefine*

This recipe presents a method to export small subsets from a full Twitter dataset based on a selection of hashtags. In particular, with this recipe, one will query a Twitter dataset with one hashtag or two or more hashtags connected by basic boolean operations (i.e., OR, AND). It can be used to extract a selection of tweets to analyse later with spreadsheet software.


# üß± Inputs

This recipe starts from a full Twitter dataset exported from the [Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset (DMI-TCAT)](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ToolDmiTcat). Still, it can be used with any Twitter data, as long as there is a column with tweets text and one column with hashtags (which should be in the same cell and separated by semicolon).
