# 🏞👀 Decontextualized images clusters (with human vision), annotated

*Visualize thematic clusters within a small set of decontextualized images.*

This approach relies on human vision to detect thematic clusters among images. In addition, removing backgrounds helps focusing on the “main” elements contained in the pictures. After removing backgrounds, images are clustered according to their content or other criteria, by hand. The process allows to have more control on definition of thematic clusters but it is very time consuming, therefore it works only with small set of images.
