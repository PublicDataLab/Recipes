# 🧮🎨 Color similarity image grid, annotated

*Identifying patterns of repetition in one image set (similar images, memes, instances of the same image)*

This approach may be used to explore a rather large collection of images. By organising all images in a regular grid based on formal similarity, one is able to spot similar images, variations of the same images, or to quantify at a glance the amount of similar elements in the image set. It may be used to map shared memes around a particular issue, or to spot users with similar profile pics (such as the [default avatar](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/31/15139092/twitter-egg-default-avatar-grey-head-trolls-change)).
