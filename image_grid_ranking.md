# üßÆüîù Image grid, by ranking and date, annotated

*Visualizing top ten images per day (week, month, year)*

This approach may be used to study how the visual representations of a particular issue changes overtime. By creating a grid in which columns represent time frames and rows represent engagement values, one is able to observe the change overtime (or lack thereof) in the type of images that create more engagement. This approach should be used with a rather small set of images (no more than 10 images per time frame).

# üóÑÔ∏è Examples

- [Top ten images per year for the query [‚Äúclimate change‚Äù] on Google.com](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B5Waf-I1sXvrXWVZUdm14lyBIvKdxy_RBCXp_-3Nly4/edit?usp=sharing)

# üß±Input from TCAT

‚Äì ‚ÄúMedia frequency‚Äù (grouped per hour, day, week, month, or year)

# üìÉ Steps

1. Open csv with media frequency and urls in Google spreadsheet
2. Sort by media frequency
3. Filter by first time frame (e.g. month of August 2019)
4. Copy first 10 urls in a new sheet (in column A)
5. Filter by second time step (e.g. month of September 2019)
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each time slot (with new column for each set)
7. For each column: create an empty column, fill it with formula `=IMAGE(URL)`
8. Hide columns with URLs, only showing columns with images
9. Style grid (add time stamps in headers, define colors and fonts for headers, set the size of columns and rows)
10. Make a screenshot
11. Annotate screenshot with [Vectr.com](https://vectr.com/)

*This and other visual methods recipes were originally formulated by [Gabriele Colombo](https://densitydesign.org/person/gabriele-colombo/) drawing on his doctoral work exploring the [design of composite images](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/141266). They were documented and refined for a module on [Digital Methods for Internet Studies: Concepts, Devices and Data](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/modules/level7/7aavdm28) convened by [Liliana Bounegru](https://lilianabounegru.org/) and [Jonathan Gray](http://jonathangray.org/) at the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh), [King‚Äôs College London](http://kcl.ac.uk/), leading to a set of collaborative group projects with their students and the [European Forest Institute](https://www.efi.int/). The approaches behind these recipes draw on several years of experimentation with images in the context of research and teaching at the [Visual Methodologies Collective](https://visualmethodologies.org/) (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences), the [Digital Methods Initiative](http://digitalmethods.net/) (University of Amsterdam), [DensityDesign Lab](https://densitydesign.org/) (Politecnico di Milano), the [m√©dialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/) (Sciences Po, Paris) and beyond. You can read more about these approaches in [Colombo, 2019](https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/handle/11311/1075861/340493/phd2019_Rampino_Mariani_Colombo.pdf) and [Niederer & Colombo, 2019](http://ojs.uc.cl/index.php/Disena/article/view/151).
