# üñ•‚ú® Setting up a research browser

*How to set up a research browser for digital methods research.*

Research browsers are often used in digital methods projects in order to gather materials from the web, search engines and platforms while mitigating personalisation effects.

As Richard Rogers writes in *Doing Digital Methods* (London: SAGE, 2019):

> By installing a separate instance of a browser (such as Firefox) as a ‚Äòresearch browser‚Äô, the researcher prepares a clean slate, free of cookies and other engine entanglements such as history and preferences.

# üìÉ Steps

The following steps are for setting up a research browser on a laptop or desktop (not a mobile or tablet device).

The main idea of these steps is to create a fresh profile and disable and minimise any preferences related to tracking and personalisation.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: You should make sure and use **only this browser profile for research** and do not attempt to sign into any websites or social media services.*

## 1. Download

*  Download the latest version of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) Desktop.

*Depending on your browser and operating system, there may be slight differences between the steps below and what you see on your screen.*

## 2. Create new profile

* Type `about:profiles` into address bar.
* Click the button that says "**Create a New Profile**"

* Click "Continue" in the popup and enter a name for your new research profile (e.g. "research browser", or whatever you'd like)
* Scroll down to the newly created profile and click the button that says "**Launch profile in new browser**".

At this point a new browser should open up! üéâ

## 3. Set browser preferences

* Type `about:preferences#privacy` into the address bar.
* Under "*Enhanced Tracking Protection*", select "**Strict**" .

* Under "*Send web sites a 'Do Not Track' signal"*, select "**Always**".

* Under "Cookies and Site Data" click "**Clear Data**".

* Under "History":
  * If you are using [Zeeschuimer](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer) select **remember history**
  * If you are using [other DMI tools](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/ToolDatabase), you may wish to select **never remember history** (as per [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj65Xr9GkJM))

> ![](images/browser06.png)

* Under "Address Bar", deselect all suggestion options.

## 4. Install DMI tools Firefox extension

* If you plan on using DMI tools, you can [install the Firefox extension](https://www.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/FirefoxToolBar) to make sure they work correctly.
